<p>Let us say that a man like you comes to this new Study. You take all the trouble to come to this 
place, and for the first few days you may want to be quiet. If you are sensitive you realize there is 
something here which is different from your home, totally different from going to a discussion 
somewhere. Then you begin to study, and not only you but all the people living here are studying, 
seeing, questioning. And everyone actually listening with their whole being will naturally bring 
about a religious atmosphere. </p>
